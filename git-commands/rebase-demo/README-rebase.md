## üìå **Script Walkthrough**

Below is a breakdown of what each step in the script does:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize Git Repository**

* Creates a folder `git-rebase-demo`.
* Initializes a new Git repository inside it.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Master Branch and Initial Commit**

* Adds `README.md` with initial content.
* Makes the first commit on `master`.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Branch (feature)**

* A new branch named `feature` is created from `master`.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Make Changes in the Feature Branch**

* Adds additional content to `README.md`.
* Commits the changes.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Switch Back to Master and Make Changes**

* Switches back to `master`.
* Adds different content to `README.md` and commits it.

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Attempt to Rebase 'feature' onto 'master'**

* Switches back to the `feature` branch.
* Tries to rebase with `master`.
* If conflicts are detected, a message is shown.

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Resolve Conflict (Manual Step)**

* If there is a conflict, you need to:

  ```bash
  # Open README.md, resolve the conflict manually
  git add README.md
  git rebase --continue
  ```

* If you want to cancel the rebase:

  ```bash
  git rebase --abort
  ```

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Final Push (Optional)**

* If rebase is successful, you can push your changes:

  ```bash
  git push origin feature
  ```
